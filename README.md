# Search Past UBC Courses by Professor

Search UBC profs by name, and find out what previous courses
they have taught. Provides average, and UBCGrades link.

Uses Bootstrap framework for styling, jQuery to allow for search, and
Flask as server to handle requests. Didn't really want to use a database
engine for this, so pandas and some CSV handles the query.
